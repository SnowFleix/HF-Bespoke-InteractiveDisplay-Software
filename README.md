# HF Bespoke InteractiveDisplay Software

The concept of this project was to allow designers from HF to design interactive displays for differenet events without the need of any software knowledge and without buying expensive off the shelf or custom made software.
The prototype is made up of two seperate apps, one that runs on the designers PC and one that will run on the interactive display. 
The design app allows a designer to create projects quickly and efficiently by simply importing background images of all the same size (in this case the width and height of each image is the same as the display size of the interactive display) or specifying a custom size of the project. 
The display app simply uses the .hen file which is just XML, to display the design.
It is important to remember this is just a prototype but I would greatly appreciate it if you kindly give me some feedback or any possible improvements to the code.

### Prerequisites

Some knowledge of C# and .NET Framwork.

### Installing

Download as a zip and extract anywhere

Make sure all the dependencies are connected, if not download them using NuGet. For some reason there is a certificate attatched to the project so you may be unable to debug the program however the .exe is within \HFBespoke First Proto\Apps along with the .exe written for the display.

## Running the tests

There are no tests for this prototype
