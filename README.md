# HF Bespoke InteractiveDisplay Software

The concept of this project was to allow designers from HF to design interactive displays for differenet events without the need of any software knowledge and without buying expensive off the shelf or custom made software.

### Prerequisites

Some knowledge of C# and .NET Framwork.

### Installing

Download as a zip and extract anywhere

Make sure all the dependencies are connected, if not download them using NuGet. For some reason there is a certificate attatched to the project so you may be unable to debug the program however the .exe is within \HFBespoke First Proto\Apps along with the .exe written for the display.

## Running the tests

There are no tests for this prototype
